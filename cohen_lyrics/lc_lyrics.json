    "lyrics": "\r\nSuzanne takes you down to her place near the river \r\nYou can hear the boats go by \r\nYou can spend the night beside her \r\nAnd you know that she's half crazy \r\nBut that's why you want to be there \r\nAnd she feeds you tea and oranges \r\nThat come all the way from China \r\nAnd just when you mean to tell her \r\nThat you have no love to give her \r\nThen she gets you on her wavelength \r\nAnd she lets the river answer \r\nThat you've always been her lover \r\nAnd you want to travel with her \r\nAnd you want to travel blind \r\nAnd you know that she will trust you \r\nFor you've touched her perfect body with your mind. \r\n\r\nAnd Jesus was a sailor \r\nWhen he walked upon the water \r\nAnd he spent a long time watching \r\nFrom his lonely wooden tower \r\nAnd when he knew for certain \r\nOnly drowning men could see him \r\nHe said \"All men will be sailors then \r\nUntil the sea shall free them\" \r\nBut he himself was broken \r\nLong before the sky would open \r\nForsaken, almost human \r\nHe sank beneath your wisdom like a stone \r\nAnd you want to travel with him \r\nAnd you want to travel blind \r\nAnd you think maybe you'll trust him \r\nFor he's touched your perfect body with his mind. \r\nNow Suzanne takes your hand \r\nAnd she leads you to the river \r\nShe is wearing rags and feathers \r\nFrom Salvation Army counters \r\nAnd the sun pours down like honey \r\nOn our lady of the harbour \r\nAnd she shows you where to look \r\nAmong the garbage and the flowers \r\nThere are heroes in the seaweed \r\nThere are children in the morning \r\nThey are leaning out for love \r\nAnd they will lean that way forever \r\nWhile Suzanne holds the mirror \r\nAnd you want to travel with her \r\nAnd you want to travel blind \r\nAnd you know that you can trust her \r\nFor she's touched your perfect body with her mind. \r\n"

now, with keener hand and brain,\r\nWe rise to play a greater part.\r\nThe lesser loyalties depart,\r\nAnd neither race nor creed remain\r\nFrom bitter searching of the heart.\r\nNot steering by the

hand\r\nAnd your legs all white\r\nFrom the winter\n\n\n\r\nI built my house beside the wood\r\nSo I could hear you singing\r\nAnd it was sweet and it was good\r\nAnd love was all beginning\r\nFare thee well my nightingale\r\n'Twas long ago I found you\r\nNow all your songs of beauty fail\r\nThe forest closes 'round you\r\nThe sun goes down behind a veil\r\n'Tis now that you would call me\r\nSo rest in peace my nightingale\r\nBeneath your branch of holly\r\nFare thee well my nightingale\r\nI lived but to be near you\r\nTho' you are singing somewhere still\r\nI can no longer hear you \n\n\r\nHurt once and for all into silence.\r\nA long pain ending without a song to prove it.\r\nWho could stand beside you so close to Eden,\r\nWhen you glinted in every eye the held-high\r\nrazor, shivering every ram and son?\r\nAnd now the silent loony bin, where\r\nThe shadows live in the rafters like\r\nDay-weary bats,\r\nUntil the turning mind, a radar signal,\r\nlures them to exaggerate\r\nMountain-size on the white stone wall\r\nYour tiny limp.\r\nHow can I leave you in such a house?\r\nAre there no more saints and wizards\r\nto praise their ways with pupils,\r\nNo more evil to stun with the slap\r\nof a wet red tongue?\r\nDid you confuse the Messiah in a mirror\r\nand rest because he had finally come?\r\nLet me cry Help beside you, Teacher.\r\nI have entered under this dark roof\r\nAs fearlessly as an honoured son\r\nEnters his father's house.  \n\n\r\nThe sea so deep and blind\r\nThe sun, the wild regret\r\nThe club, the wheel, the mind,\r\nO love, aren't you tired yet?\r\nThe club, the wheel, the mind\r\nO love, aren't you tired yet?\r\nThe blood, the soil, the faith\r\nThese words you can't forget\r\nYour vow, your holy place\r\nO love, aren't you tired yet?\r\nThe blood, the soil, the faith\r\nO love, aren't you tired yet?\r\nA cross on every hill\r\nA star, a minaret\r\nSo many graves to fill\r\nO love, aren't you tired yet?\r\nSo many graves to fill\r\nO love, aren't you tired yet?\r\nThe sea so deep and blind\r\nWhere still the sun must set\r\nAnd time itself unwind\r\nO love, aren't you tired yet?\r\nAnd time itself unwind\r\nO love, aren't you tired yet?\n\n\r\nI was dancing with my darlin'\r\nto the Tennessee Waltz\r\nWhen an old friend I happened to see\r\nIntroduced him to my loved one\r\nand while they were waltzing\r\nMy friend stole my sweetheart from me.\r\nI remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz\r\nNow I know just how much I have lost\r\nYes I lost my little darlin'\r\nThe night they were playing\r\nThe beautiful Tennessee Waltz.\r\nShe comes dancing through the darkness\r\nTo the Tennessee Waltz\r\nAnd I feel like I'm falling apart\r\nAnd it's stronger than drink\r\nAnd it's deeper than sorrow\r\nThis darkness she's left in my heart.\n"

    "lyrics": "\nI was always working steady\nBut I never called it art\nI got my shit together\nMeeting Christ and reading Marx\nIt failed my little fire\nBut it's bright the dying spark\nGo tell the young messiah\nWhat happens to the heart\n\nThere's a mist of summer kisses\nWhere I tried to double-park\nThe rivalry was vicious\nThe women were in charge\nIt was nothing, it was business\nBut it left an ugly mark\nI've come here to revisit\nWhat happens to the heart\n\n\nI was selling holy trinkets\nI was dressing kind of sharp\nHad a pussy in the kitchen\nAnd a panther in the yard\nIn the prison of the gifted\nI was friendly with the guards\nSo I never had to witness\nWhat happens to the heart\n \nI should have seen it coming\nAfter all I knew the chart\nJust to look at her was trouble\nIt was trouble from the start\nSure we played a stunning couple\nBut I never liked the part\nIt ain't pretty, it ain't subtle\nWhat happens to the heart\n\n\nNow the angel's got a fiddle\nThe devil's got a harp\nEvery soul is like a minnow\nEvery mind is like a shark\nI've broken every window\nBut the house, the house is dark\nI care but very little\nWhat happens to the heart\n\n \nThen I studied with this beggar\nHe was filthy, he was scarred\nBy the claws of many women\nHe had failed to disregard\nNo fable here no lesson\nNo singing meadowlark\nJust a filthy beggar guessing\nWhat happens to the heart\n \nI was always working steady\nBut I never called it art\nIt was just some old convention\nLike the horse before the cart\nI had no trouble betting\nOn the flood, against the ark\nYou see, I knew about the ending\nWhat happens to the heart\n\nI was handy with a rifle\nMy father's .303\nI fought for something final\nNot the right to disagree\n"
